It's a lovely fall day, and you're hiking in the woods.
...
You come to a fork in the trail.

Do you:

1) Take the path on the left?
2) Take the path on the right?


1

You take the path on the left, and soon encounter a large sun bear.

What do you do?

3) Fight
4) Flee


3

You slap the sun bear upside the snout...
...
Uh oh, that seems to have made it angry.
...
The bear rears back on its hind legs and prepares to devour you.

The end.


4

You sprint away from the bear as fast as you can.
...
You were running so fast that you become disoriented.
Have you been on this path before?
...
You arrive at a suspiciously familiar fork in the trail.

Do you:

1) Take the path on the left?
2) Take the path on the right?


2

You continue down the right path, and come to the edge of a deep,
narrow ravine. There's an old rope bridge strung across it, but it doesn't
look all that sturdy.

What do you do?

5) Walk across the bridge very carefully
6) Turn around


5

Here goes nothing... you cautiously step onto the rope bridge.
...
It creaks and sways as you inch across...
...
You've made it about halfway when there's a terrifying snapping sound, and
the far end of the bridge tears free from the cliff. So long, cruel world!

The end.


6

You're too chicken to try the bridge, but better safe than sorry. You turn
around and get back to the intersection you were at before.

Which path do you take?

1) The one to your right
7) The one that goes back to the trailhead


7

Too much adventure for one day, huh? OK, you head back to the trailhead.
...
You arrive at the parking lot and get in your car. As you drive home,
you're glad to be alive, but you have a nagging feeling that there's still
some adventure out there that you missed... maybe next time.

The end.
